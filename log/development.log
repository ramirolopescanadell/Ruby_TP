Las clases se crean dentro de un nuevo mÃ³dulo llamado **Models**. UtilicÃ© monkey Patching para ir creando las clases dentro de este mÃ³dulo.\r\n\r\n## Notas\r\nLa clase **Note**, la cual se encuentra implementada en el archivo `notes.rb` ,es la que implementa toda la funcionalidad para realizar el CRUD de las notas. Los mÃ©todos de **Note** que se encargan de manejar una nota en especifico (creaciÃ³n, eliminaciÃ³n, etc) son mÃ©todos de instancia, y los mÃ©todos que se encargan de manejar varias notas (listado) son mÃ©todos de clase. Posee un mÃ©todo de instancia llamado **create_path** el cual recibe el nombre de una nota y retorna el path de esta. Para el manejo de notas solo hay que ingresar el nombre de la nota (sin extensiÃ³n). Por ejemplo cuando creo una nota con el comando `bin/rn notes create notaNueva` (sin especificar el libro) me va a crear una nota con el siguiente path: `$HOME/.my_rns/global/notaNueva.rn`.\r\nLas instancias de la clase **Note** tienen una variable **name** que representa el nombre de la nota y una variable **book** que representan el nombre del libro al que pertenece la nota.\r\n\r\nPara el manejo de archivos (es decir, las notas) usÃ© la clase **File** la cual tiene mÃ©todos para leer archivos, borrarlos, renombrarlos, ver si existen, etc.\r\n\r\nPara editar y crear las notas use la clase **TTY::Editor** la cual viene incluida en la gema **tty-editor**. Esta clase me permite abrir un archivo con el editor de texto que tenga configurado en mi mÃ¡quina (En las variables de entorno **$EDITOR** y/o **$VISUAL**).\r\n\r\nPara el listado de notas use una gema llamada **colorputs** la cual me permite colorear el texto que se imprime en la terminal. Los libros se imprimen de un color y las notas de otro.\r\n\r\n## Libros\r\nPara el manejo de libros creÃ© una clase llamada **Book** dentro del mÃ³dulo **Models**. Esta clase al igual que **Note** tiene mÃ©todos de instancia para el manejo de un libro en especifico (creaciÃ³n, eliminaciÃ³n, etc) y mÃ©todos de clase para el manejo de varios libros (listado). En todos los mÃ©todos manejÃ© excepciones, con el fin de atrapar errores como \"El nombre del libro que se quiere crear ya existe\" o \"El libro que se quiere borrar no existe\". Esta clase tambiÃ©n incluye un mÃ©todo llamado **create_path** el cual recibe el nombre del libro y retorna el path del libro.\r\nLas instancias de la clase **Book** tienen una variable **name** que representa el nombre del libro.\r\n\r\n## Validator\r\nCreÃ© un mÃ³dulo llamado **Validator** en el archivo `models/validator.rb` dentro del mÃ³dulo **Models**. Este mÃ³dulo tiene algunos mÃ©todos (en general de validaciÃ³n) que van a usar tanto la clase **Note** como la clase **Book**. Por ejemplo el mÃ©todo **validate_name** el cual recibe un nombre (de nota o de libro) y me retorna si el nombre es vÃ¡lido o si posee caracteres invÃ¡lidos. Para simplificar hice que los nombres solamente puedan tener letras y nÃºmeros. \r\nEste mÃ³dulo tiene un mÃ©todo de clase llamado **my_rns** el cual me retorna el path del cajÃ³n de notas. Por defecto el cajÃ³n se encuentra en `$HOME/.my_rns`.\r\nAgreguÃ© unas sentencias las cuales crean el cajÃ³n de notas **.my_rns** en caso de que no exista y el libro .**my_rns/global** en caso de que no exista. \r\n\r\n## ExportaciÃ³n \r\nLas notas a exportar deben utilizar el formato de texto plano **Markdown**. Se exportan en formato HTML y se guardan en un directorio llamado **.my_exports** ubicado en el home al igual que el cajÃ³n de notas. Se respeta la estructura de directorios.\r\n\r\nPara la exportaciÃ³n de notas creÃ© un nuevo comando (Es decir una clase nueva que hereda de **Dry::CLI::Command**) dentro del archivo `commands/notes.rb`. \r\nEsta clase recibe 1 argumento opcional y 2 opciones: \r\n- **note** Es un argumento optativo que representa el nombre de la nota que se desea exportar.\r\n- **--book** Es una opciÃ³n que representa el nombre del libro del cual se desea exportar. \r\n- **--all**  Es una opciÃ³n booleana que indica que se desea exportar el cajÃ³n de notas completo.\r\n\r\nComo usar el comando:\r\n- Sin ninguna opciÃ³n ni argumento se exporta el libro global junto con sus notas.\r\n- Con la opciÃ³n **--all** se exportan todas las notas (dentro de sus libros) al directorio **.my_exports**.\r\n- Si solo se envÃ­a el nombre de la nota como argumento (sin otra opciÃ³n) se buscarÃ¡ la nota a exportar en el libro global.\r\n- Si se envÃ­a el nombre de la nota como argumento y se especifica un libro con la opciÃ³n **--book** entonces se exporta la nota de ese libro (dentro del libro).\r\n- Si solamente se especifica el nombre del libro con la opciÃ³n **--book** y no se pasa como argumento el nombre de una nota entonces se van a exportar todas las notas del libro especificado.\r\n\r\nPara realizar la exportaciÃ³n cree un mÃ©todo de instancia en la clase **Models/Note** que se encarga de exportar una nota en especÃ­fico.\r\nPara exportar con las diferentes opciones creÃ© una clase **Export** dentro del mÃ³dulo **Models** que posee mÃ©todos de clase para realizar la exportaciÃ³n que se desee. Estos mÃ©todos utilizan el metodo de la clase **Models/Note** mencionado anteriormente.\r\n\r\nUsÃ© la clase **Redcarpet::Markdown** de la gema `redcarpet` para exportar las notas a archivos con extensiÃ³n html.\r\n"}, "commit"=>"Update Note", "id"=>"126"}

Esta clase al igual que **Note** tiene mÃ©todos de instancia para el manejo de un libro en especifico (creaciÃ³n, eliminaciÃ³n, etc) y mÃ©todos de clase para el manejo de varios libros (listado). En todos los mÃ©todos manejÃ© excepciones, con el fin de atrapar errores como \"El nombre del libro que se quiere crear ya existe\" o \"El libro que se quiere borrar no existe\". Esta clase tambiÃ©n incluye un mÃ©todo llamado **create_path** el cual recibe el nombre del libro y retorna el path del libro.\r\nLas instancias de la clase **Book** tienen una variable **name** que representa el nombre del libro.\r\n\r\n## Validator\r\nCreÃ© un mÃ³dulo llamado **Validator** en el archivo `models/validator.rb` dentro del mÃ³dulo **Models**. Este mÃ³dulo tiene algunos mÃ©todos (en general de validaciÃ³n) que van a usar tanto la clase **Note** como la clase **Book**. Por ejemplo el mÃ©todo **validate_name** el cual recibe un nombre (de nota o de libro) y me retorna si el nombre es vÃ¡lido o si posee caracteres invÃ¡lidos. Para simplificar hice que los nombres solamente puedan tener letras y nÃºmeros. \r\nEste mÃ³dulo tiene un mÃ©todo de clase llamado **my_rns** el cual me retorna el path del cajÃ³n de notas. Por defecto el cajÃ³n se encuentra en `$HOME/.my_rns`.\r\nAgreguÃ© unas sentencias las cuales crean el cajÃ³n de notas **.my_rns** en caso de que no exista y el libro .**my_rns/global** en caso de que no exista. \r\n\r\n## ExportaciÃ³n \r\nLas notas a exportar deben utilizar el formato de texto plano **Markdown**. Se exportan en formato HTML y se guardan en un directorio llamado **.my_exports** ubicado en el home al igual que el cajÃ³n de notas. Se respeta la estructura de directorios.\r\n\r\nPara la exportaciÃ³n de notas creÃ© un nuevo comando (Es decir una clase nueva que hereda de **Dry::CLI::Command**) dentro del archivo `commands/notes.rb`. \r\nEsta clase recibe 1 argumento opcional y 2 opciones: \r\n- **note** Es un argumento optativo que representa el nombre de la nota que se desea exportar.\r\n- **--book** Es una opciÃ³n que representa el nombre del libro del cual se desea exportar. \r\n- **--all**  Es una opciÃ³n booleana que indica que se desea exportar el cajÃ³n de notas completo.\r\n\r\nComo usar el comando:\r\n- Sin ninguna opciÃ³n ni argumento se exporta el libro global junto con sus notas.\r\n- Con la opciÃ³n **--all** se exportan todas las notas (dentro de sus libros) al directorio **.my_exports**.\r\n- Si solo se envÃ­a el nombre de la nota como argumento (sin otra opciÃ³n) se buscarÃ¡ la nota a exportar en el libro global.\r\n- Si se envÃ­a el nombre de la nota como argumento y se especifica un libro con la opciÃ³n **--book** entonces se exporta la nota de ese libro (dentro del libro).\r\n- Si solamente se especifica el nombre del libro con la opciÃ³n **--book** y no se pasa como argumento el nombre de una nota entonces se van a exportar todas las notas del libro especificado.\r\n\r\nPara realizar la exportaciÃ³n cree un mÃ©todo de instancia en la clase **Models/Note** que se encarga de exportar una nota en especÃ­fico.\r\nPara exportar con las diferentes opciones creÃ© una clase **Export** dentro del mÃ³dulo **Models** que posee mÃ©todos de clase para realizar la exportaciÃ³n que se desee. Estos mÃ©todos utilizan el metodo de la clase **Models/Note** mencionado anteriormente.\r\n\r\nUsÃ© la clase **Redcarpet::Markdown** de la gema `redcarpet` para exportar las notas a archivos con extensiÃ³n html.\r\n"], ["updated_at", "2021-01-02 22:12:15.943900"], ["id", 126]]
